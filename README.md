# âœ¨Introduction
This project is a Library Manager designed to perform essential operations such as adding, removing, displaying, and searching for books. It provides a simple and interactive interface for users to manage a collection of books easily.

Currently, the list of books is hard-coded, but future updates aim to enhance the system by integrating features like external links or download options for each book.
